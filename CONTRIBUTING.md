# Versioning

- Keep the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) tags `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` in sync with [:octocat:FCP-INDI/C-PAC](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC).
- Append numerically increasing prerelease tags for each update of this repository between C-PAC releases.
- Create such a tag each time a branch is merged into [`main`](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC_templates/tree/main).
- Create a tag without a prerelease tag when a new C-PAC version is released.
